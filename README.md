# Deprecation Notice
This repo is now deprecated as it is re-written and replaced by the DoVue project.  
Check out the DoVue project [here](https://github.com/Jaimeloeuf/DoVue).  
Reason for deprecation is due to the lack of certain features in the AngularDart framework that is critical to the development of this project, such as a roboust Router.  
The newly re-written DoVue project is written in Vue JS instead.  
Please use this repo as reference only and nothing more! Contact me if you need help!
